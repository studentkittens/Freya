 A fun, slim little mpd client, started as student's project.

 Debugging:
===========
When using valgrind use it with the following command to kill a lot warnings caused by gtk3:
G_DEBUG=gc-friendly G_SLICE=always-malloc valgrind --leak-check=full --log-file=valg.log --suppressions=gtk.suppression

You might want to alias this.

alias gtkvg='<cmd_above>'


 Doxygen:
 ========
To generate documentation use:
 doxygen FreyaDoxygen.conf
