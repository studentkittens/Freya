h1. Freya

A fun and slim Client for the MPD Server. 
Started as some student's homework..

h2. Debugging

When using valgrind use it with the following command to kill a lot warnings caused by gtk3:
@G_DEBUG=gc-friendly G_SLICE=always-malloc valgrind --leak-check=full --log-file=valg.log --suppressions=gtk.suppression@

You might want to alias this.
@alias gtkvg='<cmd_above>'@

@doxygen FreyaDoxygen.conf@
or
